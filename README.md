## Responsive content

- Include collapsing navbar (hamburger menu)
- Include a grid layout
- Use Bootstrap or semantic-ui or similar framework

## Server provides JSON through a REST API

- Each person has forename, surname, username plus whatever you want to add
- GET method to list all people at /people
- GET method for individuals at /people/:username

- POST method for adding people, as long as username not taken
- `access_token` required for updates: `concertina` should work
- incorrect or missing access token should provide HTTP 403 error
- Response provided as JSON
- Content-type needs to be correct
- HTTP codes should be correct: use 400 for POST errors apart from access token
- On startup Delia Derbyshire (doctorwhocomposer) should be included in people
- See <app.test.js> for detailed test cases
- Can (should) add more methods to the web service

## Initial JSON response

- For GET /people
- Before any people or relationships added

`[{"username":"doctorwhocomposer",
   "forename":"Delia",
   "surname":"Derbyshire"}]`

### Initial JSON response

- For GET /people/doctorwhocomposer

`{"username":"doctorwhocomposer",
  "forename":"Delia",
  "surname":"Derbyshire"}`

Other properties can be included

## Server written in nodejs

- Recommended to use express, but not essential
- Use npm for management: installation of packages should work with `npm install`
- Make sure you use --save or --save-dev option with packages you add
- [Automated test code (Jest) provided](app.test.js) for basic REST functionality are provided
- Separate app and server so that test runs correctly

## Deployed locally and in cloud

- Local installation must not use database: use in-memory model
- You can choose cloud deployment platform e.g. OpenShift, BlueMix etc
- Local deployment with `npm start`
- You don't need to include cloud deployment instructions
- Include url of running system

## Submission

- Javascript, HTML and CSS sources, including package.json, preferably as zip
- Do not have to include node_modules in submission
- Submit two minute (max) video demonstrating how you web-site works, including all of the requiremements above
